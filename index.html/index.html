<p>My name is Brian Foxx Jr., and my favorite subject in school is Geometry. One of the activities I participate in at school is football. I do not have a part time job, and I do not currently volunteer for anything. This school year, I was recognized for being one of three students in the sophomore class at my school to get a top score on the International Baccalaureate Personal Project. My score was a 7/7. For my Personal Project, I built a computer. My favorite hobby is working with computers. I really enjoy building them. Anything that deals with technology is of interest to me. I am most passionate about computers and computer science, so this is why I would love to learn coding. My career goal is to work in the field of technology.</p>
